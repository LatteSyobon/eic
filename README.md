## Notice
This project is a multi-project.
Therefore, once the Gradle project is synchronized, it will start synchronizing all projects.  

If you only want to develop a certain version, change the include setting in the settings.gradle file in the top directory

**If you're really, really disturbed by a per-version project, you can delete that project.**
